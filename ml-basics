ML Algorithm application areas: 
  anti-spam
  image recognition
  clustering
  building recommender systems
Week 1:
Unsupervised Learning - Clustering: No training dataset given.   
can you automatically find structure in the data from that you automatically cluster the individuals into these types that I don't know in advance? 
Example: clustering of similar news items in news.google.com, where same news items are grouped together.
  Given a set of news articles found on the web, group them into sets of articles about the same stories.
  Given a database of customer data, automatically discover market segments and group customers into different market segments.
  
Application areas:
  Organise Computer clustering: which machines work together and put these machines together
  Market Segmentation: using customer dataset
  Social network analysis: find out cohesive group of friends
  Astronomical data analysis
  Google news groups cohesive news stories together
  Genomics
